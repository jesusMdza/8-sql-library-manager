SQL Library Manager

This project is designed to mimic a library database. It takes the data from a SQLite database and uses
the Sequelize ORM to run CRUD operations on it. The user can create, select, edit, delete and search for books.

Run "npm install" in the command prompt before running this project on your local machine.
